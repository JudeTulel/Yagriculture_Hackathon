### **Flowchart**

1. **Farmer Registration and Farm Mapping**
    
    - **Start**
    - Farmer registers on the Yagriculture app.
    - Farmer uses Google Maps to map the entire farm.
    - Farmer segments a section of the farm by walking to its edges and placing markers on the segmented points.
    - **Segmented Section** becomes the land used in the crowdfarming scheme.
    - **End of Farm Mapping**
2. **Investor Participation**
    
    - **Start**
    - Investors register on the Yagriculture app.
    - Investors stake their BTC in ckBTC.
    - Staked ckBTC is allocated to set up greenhouses.
    - Greenhouses are used to grow high-value crops (e.g., strawberries, tomatoes, bell peppers).
    - **End of Investor Participation**
3. **Crop Monitoring and Growth**
    
    - **Start**
    - IoT sensors and cameras are installed in the greenhouses.
    - Sensors monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
    - Cameras provide real-time video feeds to investors.
    - Data from sensors and cameras is accessible to all investors.
    - **End of Crop Monitoring**
4. **Harvest and Sale**
    
    - **Start**
    - Crops are harvested when ready.
    - Crops are sold in the market.
    - **End of Harvest and Sale**
5. **Profit Sharing**
    
    - **Start**
    - Profits from crop sales are calculated.
    - Profits are distributed among investors based on their ckBTC stake.
    - **End of Profit Sharing**
6. **End of Process**
    

### **Flowchart Summary**

- **Registration & Mapping**
    - Farmer registers → Maps farm → Segments land.
- **Investor Participation**
    - Investors stake ckBTC → Fund greenhouses for high-value crops.
- **Monitoring**
    - Install IoT sensors & cameras → Monitor crops → Provide data to investors.
- **Harvest & Sale**
    - Harvest crops → Sell crops (BTC market) → Distribute profits.

This flowchart outlines the steps and interactions between farmers, investors, and the crowdfarming system on the Yagriculture app using ckBTC.




Tokenizing investors' investments in the Crowd Farming model can be achieved by creating digital tokens that represent a stake in the crowdfarming project. These tokens can be used to track ownership, manage profit distribution, and provide liquidity for investors. Here’s how you can implement tokenization:

### **1. Create a Smart Contract**

- **Smart Contract Deployment:**
    - Develop a smart contract on the Internet Computer (ICP) that handles the issuance, distribution, and management of tokens.
    - The smart contract will represent each crowdfarming project as a unique token.

### **2. Token Issuance**

- **Investment Representation:**
    - When an investor stakes their ckBTC, they receive a corresponding number of tokens issued by the smart contract. Each token represents a share in the specific crowdfarming project.
    - The total number of tokens can be proportional to the total capital required for the project.
- **Token Allocation:**
    - If an investor stakes 10% of the required capital, they receive 10% of the tokens for that project.

### **3. Token Management**

- **Ownership & Transferability:**
    
    - Tokens are stored in the investors' digital wallets on the Yagriculture platform.
    - These tokens can be transferable, allowing investors to sell or trade them on secondary markets if desired.
- **Profit Distribution:**
    
    - Profits from the sale of crops are distributed to token holders in proportion to their token holdings.
    - The smart contract automatically calculates and distributes profits in ckBTC to the token holders' wallets.

### **4. Transparency & Monitoring**

- **Real-time Data:**
    - Token holders can access real-time data and video feeds from the farm via the Yagriculture app.
    - IoT sensors and cameras provide transparency, ensuring that investors can monitor the progress of the crops they’ve invested in.

### **5. Token Redemption or Buyback (Optional)**

- **End of Project:**
    - At the end of the crowdfarming project, investors can redeem their tokens for a share of the final profits or sell them back to the platform.
- **Buyback Program:**
    - The platform may offer a buyback program where it repurchases tokens from investors, providing liquidity.

### **6. Secondary Market Trading (Optional)**

- **Liquidity Options:**
    - Tokens could be listed on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other platforms that support the ICP ecosystem, allowing investors to trade their tokens with others.
- **Yield Farming/Staking:**
    - Investors might also stake their tokens in DeFi protocols to earn additional rewards or yield.

### **Summary:**

- **Smart Contract:** Issuance and management of tokens.
- **Token Issuance:** Represents a share in the project.
- **Profit Distribution:** Automated via smart contract.
- **Transparency:** Real-time monitoring via IoT and cameras.
- **Liquidity:** Optional secondary market trading and token buyback.
